Make sure you download the rmd file and test it. When reproducing the rmd file the image will not display because the file path of your computer will not match mine, so be sure to change it. For this project, I used data from the basketball reference page (https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2023_per_game.html) for the 2023 NBA season. I utilized web scrapping to see if there were any correlations between their stats and how well they performed. For example, I analyzed if the amount of games played was correlated with the number of points scored per game. Using lots of data, I was able to create models to display whether there is a relation between the given statistic and the player's performance that season.
